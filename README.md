Image Raker allows the user to set a list of image search keywords that the program uses to automate image retreival from search engines.
the program is broken down into 3 primary components.

File_sorter is simply a file sorting program that I have created to automate sorting my downloads folder, so that I don't have to.
the program takes the files and breaks them down by file extention i.e. .pdf, .jpg, .svg and so on. and copies them to a new directory folder on my desktop sorted
first by file type (images, books, etc.) then breaks them down into individual file extention folders.
this is an on going project. check the readme often to see any additions or changes.

To date the program works with the following files.
.pdf
.epub
.jpg
.jpeg
.svg
.bmp
.gif
.ai

I will continue to add file extentions as needed.

Image_grabber is the mechanism by which the users search requirements is accomplished.
-More information as the code is written

Image_compare takes the images found by image_grabber and compares them against the existing image sets, and ensures no duplication exists.
At this time I have not decided to include the file extension types or not.
